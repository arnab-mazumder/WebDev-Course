                <h2>Who is a FrontEnd Developer?</h2>
            </section>
            <section class="article-body">
                <p>A full stack developer is a skilled professional who is proficient in both the frontend and backend aspects of web development. This means they are capable of building a complete web application from start to finish, including everything the user interacts with directly (frontend) and the underlying systems and logic that power the app (backend). In today's digital landscape, full stack developers are highly valued for their versatility and problem-solving abilities, often acting as bridges between the design, development, and deployment processes of a project.<br>
On the frontend, full stack developers work with languages and tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. They are responsible for crafting the visual interface and user experience of the application — including layouts, buttons, forms, and animations. A good frontend ensures that users can navigate the app smoothly and interact with its features in an intuitive way. Responsive design and accessibility are also major concerns on this side, as apps need to function well across various devices and for all users.<br>
On the backend, full stack developers handle the server-side logic, databases, and APIs. They work with programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, or Ruby, depending on the project’s needs. Backend responsibilities include creating secure routes, managing user authentication, connecting with databases (like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL), and ensuring the app's performance and scalability. Full stack developers often use frameworks like Express.js, Django, or Spring Boot to structure their backend code efficiently. They must also understand server management, cloud deployment (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel), and containerization tools like Docker.<br>
Moreover, full stack developers are expected to understand how the frontend and backend communicate through RESTful APIs or GraphQL. They know how to structure data requests and responses, secure user data, and optimize communication between client and server. In many cases, they also work with version control systems like Git and collaborate on platforms such as GitHub or GitLab, especially in team settings where code collaboration and change tracking are essential.<br>
In addition to technical knowledge, a full stack developer often participates in system design, database architecture, and user experience planning. They might be responsible for identifying bottlenecks in the application, refactoring code for better performance, or integrating third-party services such as payment gateways or authentication providers. Some full stack developers also write unit and integration tests, ensuring their applications are stable and bug-free before launch.
Because of their wide-ranging skills, full stack developers are ideal for startups and agile teams, where a single developer may be needed to wear multiple hats. However, being a full stack developer doesn't mean being an expert in every technology — rather, it’s about having a strong understanding of all layers of the stack and being able to navigate between them with confidence.</p>

                <h2>What is MERN STACK?</h2>
            </section>
            <section class="article-body">
                <p>The MERN stack is a widely-used technology stack for building full-stack web applications, composed of four powerful JavaScript-based components: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Each plays a unique role in application development, working together to deliver a seamless user and developer experience. React.js is a frontend library developed by Facebook, used to create dynamic, single-page user interfaces that respond quickly to user input. On the server side, Node.js acts as the JavaScript runtime environment, allowing developers to run JavaScript on the backend. Paired with Node, Express.js is a lightweight framework that simplifies the creation of server routes, API handling, and middleware integration. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents which align perfectly with JavaScript's object-oriented nature. The MERN stack is especially popular because it uses one language — JavaScript — across the entire development process, reducing the learning curve and increasing development efficiency. It is ideal for building modern, scalable, and high-performance web applications, such as social platforms, dashboards, and e-commerce sites. The stack’s modular structure also allows developers to easily maintain and update components independently, fostering agile development practices. Overall, MERN empowers developers to create robust applications using a cohesive and developer-friendly ecosystem.</p>
